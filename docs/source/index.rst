**NeuroMechFly** is a data-driven computational simulation of adult
*Drosophila melanogaster* designed to synthesize rapidly growing
experimental datasets and to test theories of neuromechanical behavioral
control. For the technical background and details, please refer to our
`paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.17.440214v1>`__.
